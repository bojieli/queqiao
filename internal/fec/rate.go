// caps that window at this lane's share of the endpoint pair's measured
// bottleneck so that lanes cannot compound. Raising this estimate therefore
// changes how a fixed window is spent -- more parity, less payload -- and
// never how much is put on the wire.
//
// What made the floor look necessary was that the window was not fixed in
// practice: the bandwidth estimate behind it could be latched at a burst rate
