// server, a QUIC peer -- is a different client. So a rescue used to preserve
// the local SOCKS socket and silently break the far end of the association.
//
// The relay is now retained for a bounded grace period and named by a token,
// and the replacement association reclaims it. What is deliberately not
// preserved is the datagrams in flight when the lane died: those are lost, and
