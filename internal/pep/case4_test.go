// Falsification case 4 from docs/CONTROL-REDESIGN.md, and it fails.
//
// A policer drops what it cannot pass and holds nothing, so overload produces
// loss and no delay. Loss is no longer a congestion signal and there is no
// queue for the delay bound to measure, so neither brake can act. The design
// predicted this case would fail; it does, and by more than expected.
//
// This is a characterization test. It asserts the defect rather than the fix,
// so that the behaviour cannot change silently in either direction. If it
// starts failing because the sender no longer overdrives, that is the case
// being resolved: update it and the design document together.
//
// It matters more than a hypothetical, because internal/pathsim records that
// the live path this project targets is a policer -- "at twice the bottleneck
// rate it shows arrival runs averaging 2.3 packets and loss runs averaging
// 5.7 ... a limiter which passes everything for a while and then drops
// everything for a while".
