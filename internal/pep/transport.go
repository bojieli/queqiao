// percent packet loss, loss recovery delays consumption enough that the
// window stops growing, and the *receive window* rather than congestion
// control becomes the binding constraint. Measured with cmd/queqiaobench at
// 200 ms RTT and 1--5% loss, a 512 KiB initial stream window cost 30--40%
// goodput against an otherwise identical TUIC-shaped reference.

// 16 MiB connection send window with no ramp at all. These constants match it

// Mbit/s on a 50 MiB transfer) by letting the sender hold a deeper standing
// queue at the bottleneck, and it cost far more than it bought at the tail:
// interactive requests issued during that transfer went from a 489--701 ms
// 95th percentile to 976--1062 ms, and from an 883 ms worst case to 1339 ms.
