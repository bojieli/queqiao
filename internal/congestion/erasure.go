// ErasureSender is BBR on a path that erases packets for reasons that have
// nothing to do with congestion.
//
// Measured on the China-US path this project targets, about 42% of packets are
// dropped independently of the sending rate: at 1 Mbit/s as readily as at 12,
// and ICMP loses 37% at five packets a second
// (docs/PATH-CHARACTER-20260813.md). Every loss-responsive controller gives
// the path away. Across the emulated channel, carrying QUIC datagrams:
//
//	default (Reno/Cubic)          0.13 Mbit/s
//	BBR                           0.39
//	BBR-TUIC                      1.36
//	Brutal, told 25 Mbit/s        13.89
//
// Only Brutal gets the path, and only because it ignores loss and paces at a
// rate a human typed in. This controller is meant to reach the same place
// without being told, which needs two corrections rather than one.
//
// The first is that channel loss must not read as congestion. Which loss is
// which is not a policy but a measurement: the erasure floor is the loss that
// does not respond to sending more slowly, and the excess above it is the part
// a sender caused. Only that excess is passed to BBR.
//
// The second is subtler and is why plain BBR collapses rather than merely
// under-shooting. BBR's bandwidth estimate is the rate that is *delivered*,
// while its pacer governs the rate that is *sent*. On a clean path those are
// the same number. On an erasure channel they differ by the arrival rate, and
// pacing a delivered-rate estimate makes the sending rate its own input:
// sending S delivers S(1-p), which becomes the next estimate, which is paced
// as S(1-p), which delivers S(1-p)^2. Every rate is a fixed point of that loop
// only in the sense that zero is; in practice it walks down to nothing, which
// is the 0.39 Mbit/s above. Dividing the pacing rate by the arrival rate
// restores the property BBR assumes, and the loop then converges on the
// bottleneck rather than on zero: in startup S grows by the gain each round
// until delivery stops growing, which happens exactly when S reaches the
// bottleneck.
//
// What it does not do is ignore congestion. Above the bottleneck the loss
// stops being memoryless -- the live path's loss runs grow from 1.7 packets to
// 5.7 -- the excess over the floor becomes positive, and BBR sees it and backs
// off.
