// Which segments a path actually shares is an empirical question, and this is
// the instrument for answering it.
//
// The tree in tree.go is bootstrapped from a static hierarchy -- uplink, then
// region, then peer -- which encodes somebody's belief about what is shared.
// That belief is testable: two destinations sit behind a common bottleneck if
// and only if congestion at one shows up at the other. When it does, they
// belong under one node and should pool what they learn; when it does not,
// giving them a shared node makes a busy peer throttle a healthy one.
//
// The trap is correlating the wrong thing. Loss and delay on almost any two
// Internet paths rise in the evening and fall at four in the morning, so
// correlating levels finds that everything correlates with everything and
// collapses the tree to a single root for a reason that has nothing to do with
// a shared bottleneck. What distinguishes a genuinely shared segment is that
// its congestion arrives and leaves *together*, on the scale of a queue rather
// than of a working day.
//
// So this correlates first differences of short buckets. Differencing removes
// any trend the two series have in common -- which is exactly the diurnal
// signal -- and leaves the sub-second coincidences that a shared queue
// produces and independent paths do not.
