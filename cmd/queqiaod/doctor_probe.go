// This file adds the one measurement a deployment needs before it exists and
// cannot get from anywhere else: whether this gateway is on the useful side of
// this client's path to a destination it actually calls.
//
// The rest of the doctor checks preconditions on the host. Those are worth
// checking and they are not the question an operator gets wrong. The question
// an operator gets wrong is placement, because the transport improves the
// client-to-gateway segment and nothing past it, so a gateway sited on the
// wrong side of the traffic's real bottleneck lengthens the path while every
// local check passes. A destination fronted by an anycast edge is the ordinary
// way this happens: the session terminates at a point of presence near the
// client, the long haul runs inside the provider's own backbone where neither
// end of this transport can reach it, and routing that traffic through a
// distant gateway adds the whole gateway leg for nothing.
//
// What follows measures connection establishment and stops there. Establishment
// is what placement determines, and it is the part a local instrument can hold
// still. Throughput, loss, and completion time under load belong to
// cmd/pathprobe and cmd/pathmeasure, which drive the path rather than sampling
// it, and this command should not grow into a worse copy of either.

// latency reduces a set of establishment samples to the three figures a
// placement decision is read from.
//
// The minimum is the path's own floor -- the sample least contaminated by a
// queue, and the reference a delay-bounded controller holds itself against. The
// median is what a caller usually gets. The tail is what a caller held to a p99
// is held to, and it moves independently of the median often enough that
// reporting either alone is misleading: on the characterised path a warm
// request sat at 240.9ms at the median and 916.7ms at p99 in a minute when the
// path was erasing, a spread no median would have shown.
